# SpatDiv 0.1-1

## New features

* Species distribution S3 methods : `as.AbdVector()`, `as.ProbaVector()` for `wmppp` objects, factors and character vectors.

* `Tsallis()` and `Diversity()` for `wmppp` objects, factors and character vectors.

* `rSpCommunity()`generates a spatialized random community (in a `wmppp` object). In progress: limited to a binomial point process.

* `EntAccum()` and `DivAccum()` calculate entropy and diversity accumulations curves. DAC's can be plotted by `plot.DivAccum()`
